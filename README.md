# Automation QA Portfolio — Playwright

This repository contains **end-to-end (E2E) UI automation tests** built with **Playwright**.

The goal is to demonstrate practical automation QA skills by testing my own deployed apps (The Odin Project projects and other small web apps).

## Notes

### Odin Todo

- When running tests locally, serve the Todo app with a static server (Python). Don’t use VS Code Live Server because it can reload the page mid-test.

### Odin Weather

- N/A
